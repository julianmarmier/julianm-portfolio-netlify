A﻿ few years ago to practice developing apps on the Electron platform, I decided to create an app to sort files after having seen a similar one online. Since I wasn't incredibly experienced with JS frameworks, I went for vanilla JavaScript, which was a terrible mistake—not only did it bring out the laziest parts of my coding self, but it also didn't feature any type checking, leading to more than one multi-hour debug session to realize some undefined object property was incorrectly returned.

F﻿ast-forward to 2022, where I've decided to fix my past mistakes by… starting over! Meet [Organiz](https://organize.julianmarmier.com)
