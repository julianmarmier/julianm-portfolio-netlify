During the COVID-19 pandemic, my friend Lyla Chereau decided to help raise money for the [Project Bread's Walk for Hunger](https://www.projectbread.org/the-walk-for-hunger). Since the walk couldn't take place for obvious reasons, instead she decided to setup a mask-selling organization instead to raise money for the Food Bank. I helped by creating the website built on React and Gatsby, complete with a Netlify CMS backend.

The idea ended up being an immense success and even led to the creation of a chapter in San Fransisco. The project has been discontinued since the end of the pandemic, but it is still available for viewing at [masksforhunger.marmier.co](https://masksforhunger.marmier.co).
