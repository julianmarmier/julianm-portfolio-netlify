  **learning student** above all.
bio: >-
  Born in Boston, raised by Swiss parents. Fascinated by the concept of a
  computer and especially software since I was young. Also interested in graphic
  design and typography.


  Today I like to mix both design and technology into what I do—you can’t have the function without the form!


  I have moderate experience with coding, frontend web design and development, as well as basic knowledge of 3D modeling and rendering, and 2D animation.
